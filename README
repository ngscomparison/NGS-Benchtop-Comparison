This repository contains the extended supplementary information, i.e. the sequencing data, assemblies, mappings, and scripts, for the publication:
  
  Jünemann S, Sedlazeck FJ, Prior K, Albersmeier A, John U, Kalinowski J, Mellmann A, Goesmann A, von Haeseler A, Stoye J, Harmsen D (2013). Updating benchtop sequencing performance comparison. Nature Biotechnology 31, 294–296, doi:10.1038/nbt.2522.

In the following folders you will find what is needed to reproduce the results:
./mapping   :contains mapping alignments (sorted BAM) of uniquely mapped reads
./assembly  : contains de novo assembly results obtained by MIRA v3.4.0 (ACE files)
./results   : contains SNP and InDel variants, MLST+ results, corresponding R scripts for visualization and the Sanger sequencing results
./reads     : contains raw, trimmed and sub-sampled reads generated in the course of this study. 
./references: the genomic reference sequences used
./scripts   : scripts used to process and analyse the sequencing data divided into corresponding subfolders

All sequencing data, mapping and assembly results can be downloaded at:
