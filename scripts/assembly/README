In order to run a complete assemly, run the script RUN_ASSEMBLY_PIPELINE.sh

Scripts that were used to evaluate the sequencing technologies based on de novo assemblies:
RUN_ASSEMBLY_PIPELINE.sh:
  Pipeline to run Mira for de novo analysis
  Requires: raw reads (+ancillary files for GSJ/PGM, i.e. the xml traceinfo for 454/PGM as generated by MIRA's sff_extract), reference techmode, paired_end dist
  Output: 

sub_sample.py and sub_sample_paired.py:
  Sub-samples input fastq file(s) to a given percentage
  Requires: input fastq file(s) and a percentage value
  Output: sum-sampled fastq files

summarize_assembly_results.pl: 
  Generate tables based on output of mauve
  Requires: file containing the dirnames/sample name of mapping result 
  Output: TSV assembly result table

assemblathon_stats.pl  :
  Computes multiple metrics for de novo assembly (e.g. N50)
  Requires: assembly contigs or scaffolds and reference file
  Output: assembly metrics
