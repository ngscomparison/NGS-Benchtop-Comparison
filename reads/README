All sequencing, mapping and assembly data can be downloaded at:

  ftp://ftp.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/ngscomparison/reads 

Furthermore, Sequencing reads were deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive and are available under the accession number SRS352585:
  
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?sample=SRS352585

In the following folders you will find the sequencing reads used during this study. 

./raw           : sequencing data as directly generated by the sequencing instruments
./trimmed       : pre-processed sequencing data (trimmed and merged reads in the case of the MiSeq and GSJ data)
./subsampled    : further sub-sabpled to optimal coverage rates for the de novo assembly

For a detailed description of data pre-processing please see the read processing section of the online supplementary material.
