All sequencing, mapping and assembly data can be downloaded at:

  ftp://ftp.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/ngscomparison/reads 

Furthermore, Sequencing reads were deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive and are available under the accession number SRS352585:
  
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?sample=SRS352585

In the following folders you will find the sequencing reads used during this study. 

./raw           : sequencing data as provided by the sequencing machine derectly
./trimmed       : pre-processed sequencing data (trimmed and merged reads the case of the MiSeq and GSJ data)
./subsampled    : trimmed data further sub-sabpled to optimal coverage rates for the de novo assembly

The directories labeled as "raw" contains fastq files as generated directly by the sequencing machines.
The directory labeled as "trimmed" contains further pre-processed fastq data (trimmed "more stringent").
For a detailed description of data pre-processing please see the read processing section of the online supplementary material.
