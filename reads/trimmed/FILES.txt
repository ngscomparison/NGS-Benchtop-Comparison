sakai_gsj-both.fastq.zip    : Processed (trim_morestringent.pl) and combined (1+2) runs of the 454 GSJunior raw data
sakai_mis_2x150pb-both-trimmed.fastq.zip : Processed (trim_morestringent.pl) and combined forward & reverse pairs of the raw MiSeq data (fastq is shuffled, named according to the MIRA paired-end naming scheme and cleaned, i.e. incomplete pairs removed)
