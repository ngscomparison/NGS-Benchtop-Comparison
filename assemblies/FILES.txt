In this folder you will find the de novo assembly results as reported by MIRA v3.4.0 (zipped ACE format) for the 

sakai*     : Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sakai datasets

The reads were pre-processed and assembled de novo as described in the methods section of the manuscript. 
Prior to the assemblies, MiSeq and PGM data were randomly sub-samplled to approx. 75 and 40 fold coverage, respectively.
