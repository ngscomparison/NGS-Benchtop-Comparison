Directories:

uncorrected_variances	: All raw variances as reported by SeqSphere+ 
corrected_variances	: All variances after manual correction for overlapping genes/positions

Files:

variants_assembly.R	: The R script to generate the Venn diagrams 
    For the R scripts, the data has to be provided in two files, one for the SNPs and one for the InDels.
    Each line those files contains two columns (separated by tab), the first column indicating the platform and
    the second column lists all identified variants, separated by comma. First line is for the PGM, second  MiSeq and third GSJ.

A more detailed description about how to use SeqSphere+ to produce the lists for Fig. 1 and how the exported the list were produced can be found at: http://www.seqsphere.de/doc/NGS_Comparison_VennChart
