In the subsequent folder you will find uniquely mapped reads as sorted bam files for the Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sakai datasets.

The reads were pre-processed and mapped against the corresponding references as described in the methods section of the manuscript.

sakai_gsj-both.bam  :   reference mapping results of both combined 454 GSJunior runs
sakai_mis-2x150bp.bam   :   reference mapping results of the MiSeq paired-end data (1/4th lane), not using paired-end information (applied quality trimming: trim_morestringent.pl)
sakai_mis-2x250bp.bam   :   reference mapping results of the MiSeq 2x250bp paired-end data (1/4th lane), not using paired-end information (applied quality trimming: trim_morestringent.pl)
sakai_pgm_100bp.bam :   reference mapping results of the PGM data (one 316 chip) with 100bp chemistry (applied quality trimming: 'more stringent" via the TorrentSuite v2.2 filter enabled)
sakai_pgm_200bp.bam :   reference mapping results of the PGM data (one 316 chip) with 200bp chemistry (applied quality trimming: 'more stringent" via the TorrentSuite v2.2 filter enabled)
sakai_pgm_300bp.bam :   reference mapping results of the PGM data (1/2 318 chip) with 300bp chemistry (applied quality trimming: 'more stringent" via the TorrentSuite v3.0 filter enabled, recalibration disabled)
sakai_pgm_400bp.bam :   reference mapping results of the PGM data (one 318 chip) with 400bp chemistry (applied quality trimming: 'more stringent" via the TorrentSuite v3.2 filter enabled, recalibration disabled)
